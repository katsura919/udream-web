# Photos for the Belgrade "Lela" listing (Zvezdara)

Drop the apartment photos into this folder using these exact filenames.
The page picks them up automatically ~ no code changes needed. Until a file
is present, the site shows a tidy placeholder in its place.

| Filename            | What it should show                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `open-plan.jpg`     | The wide open-plan shot (kitchen island + TV) ~ this is the HERO |
| `living-room.jpg`   | The grey sectional sofa + white coffee table + artwork    |

Tips:
- Use `.jpg` (or update the `src` values in `src/data/accommodations.ts`).
- To add MORE photos later, save them here and add an entry to this listing's
  `images` array in `src/data/accommodations.ts`.

## Optional: "Getting around" route maps

Add these to show a route-map row in the Location section (optional):
